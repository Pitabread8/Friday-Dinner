                        Voters rank the candidates from favorite to least favorite by marking which candidate is their first choice, which is their second choice, and so on. 
                        There are a few different voting systems that count ranked ballots, and while each system has its own flaws, 
                        any of them can be chosen to count votes using Ranked voting.

                        <span style="color: #E07A5F;">Red</span> has a higher ranking. If a majority of the rest of the ballots in this election also rank

                        Ranked voting is best in situations when the voter’s personal preferences need to be recorded. 
                        This works in situations where people need to be sorted into groups according to their preferences. 
                        If one group has too many members, some voters can be sorted into other groups based on their second or third choices. 
                        Thus, the voters are evenly split into groups that they want.
