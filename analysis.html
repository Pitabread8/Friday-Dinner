                    <p class="info-p">Plurality voting, commonly known as First Past the Post, is the most common voting system. 
                        It is used everywhere in the world, in all sorts of situations. 
                        In the United States, people are pushing for Plurality to replace the Electoral College system (The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact).

                    <p class="info-p">This method is the best for any situation involving only two candidates. 
                        All other systems eventually use Plurality in two candidate elections.

                        The winning candidate is generally the one nearest to the biggest cluster of voters, regardless of its proximity to all of the voters overall. 
                        Below, the majority of voters are on the right side, yet <span style="color: #9b6873;">Candidate 2</span>, which is isolated in the left, is the winner. 
                        This is because both <span style="color: #d07b50;">Candidate 0</span> and <span style="color: #4058e3;">Candidate 1</span> are on the same side. 
                        This causes the votes to be split among the two, allowing <span style="color: #9b6873;">Candidate 2</span> to win.
