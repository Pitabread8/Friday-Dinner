                    We analyzed four voting systems and their benefits in day-to-day use. 
                    You can test them yourself in our <a href="sim.html">voting simulator</a>. 
                    Definitions of common voting terms and more information about the systems can be found in the <a href="resources.html">resources</a> page.

                        Plurality voting, commonly known as First Past the Post, is the most common voting system. 
                        It is used everywhere in the world, in all sorts of situations. 
                        In the United States, people are pushing for Plurality to replace the Electoral College system (The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact).

                        The winning candidate in Plurality is generally the one nearest to the biggest cluster of voters, even if the cluster makes up a small percentage of all of 
                        the voters. Below, the majority of voters are on the right side, but the largest cluster of voters is near <span style="color: #64495A;">Candidate 2</span>,
                        which is isolated on the left. The votes on the right side are split evenly by <span style="color: #F2CC8F;">Candidate 0</span> and 
                        <span style="color: #E07A5F;">Candidate 1</span>, removing the chance of either of them winning.
