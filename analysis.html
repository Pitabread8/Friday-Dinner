                        In the United States, people are pushing for Plurality to replace the Electoral College system (The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact).

                        Voters rank the candidates from favorite to least favorite by marking which candidate is their first choice, which is their second choice, and so on. 
                        There are a few different voting systems that count ranked ballots, and while each system has its own flaws, 
                        any of them can be chosen to count votes using Ranked voting.

                        Then, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated, and the votes of those who voted for this candidate 
                        as their first choice go to whomever they voted for as second choice. This procedure gets repeated until one candidate has at least 50% of the vote.

                    <p class="info-p">
                        Ranked voting is best in situations when the voter’s personal preferences need to be recorded. 
                        This works in situations where people need to be sorted into groups according to their preferences. 
                        If one group has too many members, some voters can be sorted into other groups based on their second or third choices. 
                        Thus, the voters are evenly split into groups that they want.
                        <br><br>
                        Something to note is that because spoiler effect may be present in some of the Ranked voting systems, voters may rank a candidate that is not their first choice as 
                        their first choice. This may be because the voter prefers one majority candidate over another even though neither is their first choice.

                        This system is best for situations where people do not have enough information to choose or rank an option, 
                        or if the options could result in the exclusion of some group members.
                        Approval would be most useful in casual settings rather than public elections, when the decision has a small or temporary impact.
                        <br><br>
                        Something to note is that because this system is susceptible to the reverse spoiler effect, voters may not vote for options that they want but are not their
                        first choice in fear that they are reducing their first choice candidate's chance of winning.
                        Remember, voting for all of the candidates on the ballot using this system is the same as voting for none because each candidate gets the same amount of points from you.

                        Score voting, also known as range voting, is a point-based system. Score voting is not in widespread use in any public elections, although it is quite similar 
                        to the systems judges at the Olympics use and the product rating systems found in e-commerce.

                    <p class="info-p">
                        Voters individually rate each candidate, often on a scale of one to five or one to ten.
                        The rating of each candidate on each ballot is totalled and the candidate with the highest sum wins.
                        This system seems similar to the <a href="#borda">Borda Count</a>, but because each candidate is rated irrespective of the others, more than one candidate can
                        have the same rank/score.

                        Score voting is perfect in situations where something or someone is being judged/reviewed. Any situation that requires each candidate to be evaluated individually
                        would also work well.

                        Something to note is that because this system is susceptible to the reverse spoiler effect, voters may rank candidates that are not their first choice lower than 
                        they really believe in fear that they are reducing their first choice candidate's chance of winning.
                        For example, they may give all candidates except their first choice the score of the lowest possible score (usually zero or one) and their first choice the 
                        highest score (usually five or ten) even if they those numbers don't reflect their true feelings.
